# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to analyze the temperature trends for June and December in Oahu, HI.  This data will be used to determine the viability of a year round Surf and Ice Cream shop.  Considering that it's Hawaii, it seems like a no brainer but let's let the data speak for itself.  

## Descriptive Stats - June

## Descriptive Stats - December

## Key Differences
- The largest contrast between these two months is the minimum temperature at 64 deg and 56 deg for June and December respectively.
- There nearly a four degree difference in mean temperature between these two months.
- The max temperature variance between the month is at a difference of only two degrees.  

## Summary
The temperature data shows that Hawaii is a paradise as described.  The minimum temperature variance seaonally fluctuates as expected anywhere else.  It is recommended for precipitation trends to be analyzed. It is also recommended for both temperature and precipitation at multiple locations on the island to determine the most optimal placement of the business.  Lastly, it might be wise to analyze trends in tourism statistics as this business model could potentially be optimized in a seasonal approach.  

Thank you for your business and we look forward to further opportunities in providing further analytical services.
