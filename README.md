# Surfs Up Challenge

## Overview
The purpose of this challenge is to analyze the temperature trends for June and December in Oahu, HI.  This data will be used to determine the viability of a year round Surf and Ice Cream shop.  Considering that it's Hawaii, it seems like a no brainer but let's let the data speak for itself.
